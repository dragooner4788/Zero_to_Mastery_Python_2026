# Introduction

Welcome to my **Zero to Mastery**: Complete Python Developer in 2026 Repo!

I will be working through the learnings and the problems from the course [Complete Python Developer in 2026: Zero to Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-python/). 

Of course, as I learn, I will be adding in my own thoughts, and additional work while I learn the language better. 

# Format

## Jupyter Notebooks

I am using the Jupyter Notebooks extension from within VS Code. I am doing this because it makes it convenient while learning to write code, and to write Markdown at the same time and document my learning as I work
through the problems. 

- There will be corrections, but I will try to keep the cells separate when I can so that you can "see my work" as I learn and progress through various problems and concepts. 

## VS Code

As I stated above, I am using VS Code, and not all of my coding will be done within a Notebook. 

# Goals

1. Get a Software Developer Role
2. Get a Promotion
3. Do something I find challenging, rewarding and fun
